# Iris Model Deployment Using Flask on Heroku

Project Overview:

This project was developed as part of the Data Glacier Internship during Week 4 and 5. It involves the deployment of a machine learning model that classifies species of the Iris flower based on the dataset provided. The model is built using Python and Flask and deployed on Heroku, offering a practical demonstration of web app and API deployment.

Features:

Data Source: Iris dataset (iris.csv)

Model: Flower Classification Model

Technologies Used: Flask for API creation and Heroku for deployment.


Deployment:

The model is hosted as a web application on Heroku, providing a user-friendly interface and API access.

Week 4: Initial deployment using Flask.
Week 5: Refined deployment process on Heroku, improving stability and performance.
